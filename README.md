# generator-bones-bleached

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matt-bailey/generator-bones.png)](https://travis-ci.org/matt-bailey/generator-bones) -->

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for scaffolding out a basic web project.

It's based on [generator-bones](https://github.com/matt-bailey/generator-bones) made by [@_mattbailey](http://twitter.com/_mattbailey), but integrated with [inuit.css](https://github.com/inuitcss/getting-started) as CSS framework. I've also dropped Mocha and Grunticon, for the moment.
A note for inuit: the modules you found in this distribution are the modules I use the most, not all the availables one. Also, the custom .scss files are highly optionated on my average project needs, so feel free to drop them or modify them as needed.

## Getting started

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator globally: `npm install -g generator-bones-bleached`
- Run: `yo bones-bleached`
- Run: `grunt`

<!-- This is what your project will look like once you've run `yo bones` and `grunt`: -->
